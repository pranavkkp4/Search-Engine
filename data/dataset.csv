1,Machine Learning,"Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that learn from data and improve with experience. It encompasses supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms that can be applied to tasks such as classification, regression and clustering."
2,Natural Language Processing,"Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret and generate human language. It combines linguistics and machine learning to solve tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, summarisation and conversational agents."
3,Computer Vision,"Computer vision gives machines the ability to interpret visual information from images and video. It includes techniques for object detection, image classification, segmentation and facial recognition using deep neural networks and traditional image processing."
4,Data Science,"Data science blends statistics, programming and domain expertise to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data. Practitioners clean, transform and analyse data to generate insights and build predictive models to inform decisions."
5,Deep Learning,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data. It has revolutionised fields like computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing through models such as convolutional and recurrent networks."
6,Web Development,"Web development involves designing and building websites and web applications. It spans front‑end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as back‑end frameworks, databases and APIs that power dynamic, interactive sites."
7,Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks and data from unauthorised access, attack or damage. It involves risk assessment, encryption, authentication and monitoring to defend against threats such as malware, phishing and hackers."
8,Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing delivers computing resources—servers, storage, databases, networking, software—over the internet. It enables scalable, on‑demand access to IT infrastructure through service models like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)."
9,Blockchain Technology,"Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions in a secure, decentralised way. It underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and enables smart contracts, supply‑chain tracking and other applications requiring trust without a central authority."
10,Internet of Things,"The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, sensors and appliances embedded with electronics and connectivity. These objects collect and exchange data, enabling smarter homes, cities, industry and healthcare systems."
11,Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and seeks to maximise cumulative reward through trial and error."
12,Genomics,"Genomics is the study of the structure, function, evolution and mapping of genomes—the complete set of DNA within an organism. High‑throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools enable analysis of genetic variation and its relation to traits and diseases."
13,Quantum Computing,"Quantum computing leverages principles of quantum mechanics to perform certain computations far more efficiently than classical computers. Using quantum bits (qubits) and phenomena like superposition and entanglement, quantum algorithms promise breakthroughs in cryptography, optimisation and simulation."
14,Edge Computing,"Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to where data is generated. By processing information at the network edge—on devices or local servers—it reduces latency, saves bandwidth and enables real‑time applications such as autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT."
15,Augmented Reality,"Augmented reality (AR) overlays digital content onto the physical world, enhancing perception and interaction. AR applications use cameras, sensors and graphics to blend virtual objects with real environments for gaming, training, shopping and navigation."
16,Robotics,"Robotics deals with the design, construction and operation of robots—machines capable of carrying out complex tasks automatically. It combines mechanical engineering, electronics, control systems and software to enable autonomous or teleoperated movement and perception."
17,Recommendation Systems,"Recommendation systems predict user preferences and suggest relevant items such as movies, products or news articles. They employ collaborative filtering, content‑based methods and hybrid approaches to deliver personalised experiences and improve engagement."
18,Time Series Analysis,"Time series analysis examines data points collected sequentially over time. Techniques include decomposition, forecasting, smoothing and modelling using ARIMA, exponential smoothing or neural networks to uncover trends and make predictions."
19,Computer Graphics,"Computer graphics is the field of generating and manipulating visual content with computers. It encompasses rendering, modelling, animation and visual effects used in video games, films, virtual reality and scientific visualisation."
20,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics combines biology, computer science and mathematics to analyse biological data such as DNA sequences, protein structures and gene expression. It develops algorithms and software to understand biological processes and accelerate research in genomics and personalised medicine."
